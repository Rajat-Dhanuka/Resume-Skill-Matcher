## 📍 Overview
The primary goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive resume classification system that leverages both traditional machine learning (ML) techniques and deep learning (DL) models. The project is divided into distinct phases, including data pre-processing, data analysis, and a comparative study of Bag of Words (BoW), Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), and Word2Vec for multi-class classification. Additionally, the project aims to design, implement, and train a deep learning model for multi-class classification of resumes based on skill keywords.
